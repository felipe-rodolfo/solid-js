Imagine that you are developing a system for a transportation company and need to implement a concept of vehicles. Think of a class hierarchy to represent different types of vehicles, such as Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Make sure to correctly apply the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) so that derived classes can be used in place of the base class without issues. Additionally, consider which methods and attributes can be common to both the base and derived classes.
